# spring-swagger
Spring boot 3 with Swagger is implemented using open api.
Now we dont need spring fox 2 dependency only open-api spring webvc dependency will work.

Swagger provides and easy way to document the rest api so that consumers or those who wants to integrate can use this document.
Swagger provides api development tool as well. 

I created a OpenApiConfig class and anntated with sevelral properties @OpneApiDocumentation.
